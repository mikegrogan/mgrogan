The following is my current web development setup and things that I use in my day to day life. It is inspired from Wes Bos's <a href="http://uses.tech" target="_blank">Uses.Tech</a> page. Hopefully there's a few interesting things in there for anyone checking out the list.

### Design and Development
* [**Visual Studio Code**][1] has been my go to editor for years now. These are the main extensions/theme I use:
  * Solarized Dark
  * CFML
  * GitLens
  * Git History
* **Windows 10**
* [**Commandbox**][4] runs my local Coldfusion development environment. It's a must have for any Coldfusion developer.
* [**Windows Terminal**][2] is great at managing multiple shells and letting me color code my backgrounds depending on what environment I'm in.
* [**Figma**][5] is a lot of fun to use as a non-designer. Much more intuitive than something like Illustrator in my mind.
* **Adobe Creative Suite** I use mostly for Photoshop and Lightroom.
* [**Insomnia Core**][8] is helpful for managing and testing REST web services.
* [**Toad for Oracle**][9] is the best tool I've found for working with Oracle databases.
* [**Google Cloud free tier**][6] is what I used to setup this site running on Ubuntu. It doesn't have a monthly cost associated with it, which is great for a small site like this. I just have to maintain the domain.

### Desktop Apps, Plugins, Tools
* [**Powertoys**][3] I use mostly for the FanyZones feature.
* [**Vivaldi**][7] is built on Chromium, but goes the extra mile with lots of great extra features. Helps me de-google a little bit as well.
* [**KeepassXC**][10] My choice for a personal password manager.
* [**TeraCopy**][11] Provides a little more control when copying files.
* [**Chocolatey**][12] I use to manage my installed software and keep everything up to date.

### Camera Gear
* **Canon 6d** is definitely little outdated now. As a side hustle I shot a few weddings with it and thought it performed well. It's decent for photos, but wouldn't recommend it for video.
* [**Sigma 70-200mm F2.8 DG OS HSM**][16] has been a great portrait lens for me, and is considerably cheaper than the Canon equivalent.

### Home Network
* Raspberry Pi running [**PiHole**][13] to block ads. Have to make use of the Pi somehow!
* [**MikroTik hAP ac2 router**][14] gave me the best bang for my buck when searching for a new router. It has the powerful [RouterOS ][15] running on it that let me do things like setting up a VPN, creating multiple subnets, or automating backups.
* Ran Cat 6 throughout my house to get the best possible connection.
